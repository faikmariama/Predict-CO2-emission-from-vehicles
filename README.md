Exploratory Data, Machine learning, supervised/unsupervised learning, regression

# Project Introduction:
This project is based on a CO2_Emission_Canada database that we downloaded via the kaggle website. The objective of the project is to predict the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by different cars using supervised learning techniques ( in particular, regression is used here) and unsupervised (Clustering: K_means).

## Methods used:

1. Data analysis and exploration
2. Data visualization
3. Machine learning

## Machine Learning Algorithm:

1. Univariate linear regression
2. Multivariate linear regression
3. Clustering: Algorithm of K_means

## Metrics used for model evaluation:

1. RMSE (root mean square error):
RMSE is the standard deviation of prediction errors called residuals. The residuals indicate the randomness of the data points in the regression line. RMSE tells us how much the data is concentrated around the regression line.
2. MAE (Mean Absolute Error):
MAE measures the absolute distance between actual data and predicted data.
3. R_square:
R-Square is another statistical measure that indicates how close the regression predictions are to the actual data points.

## Tools and libraries used:

1. Python
2. Pandas, NumPy
3. Scikit-learn
4. Matplotlib
5. Seaborn
